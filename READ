# Can split trajectory in order to compare run against self: 
	-> split_traj.py

# Compute distance between a selected pair of atoms:
	-> distance_histogram.py

# Takes trajectory + parmfile - generates histrograms of psi, phi (can add chi angles too): 
	->  psi_phi_histogram.py

# For comparing one or two things (ie distance between 2 atoms) can use this script: 
	-> KL_div_corr.py

# For comparing various things, this script in combo with this bash script (i.e. for all torsional angles):
	- This calculates KL div:
	-> KL_run_all_test.py
	
	- This runs through all files in a directory to feed to the above script:
	-> script_run_all_KL.sh

# After running that last bash script, end up with a folder of files, each with the KL value for each torsion. 

To plot this into a PDB file, need a file which has these values as a list.
